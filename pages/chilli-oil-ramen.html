            There are plenty of times when I’m happily scrolling through my account, only to stumble upon one of these recipes which immediately grips my full attention, making me crave for it so bad until I feel the need to make it right at that instant!

            This chili oil instant ramen went viral on the TikTok-sphere sometime earlier this year, and I was so mad at myself that I never thought to make it that way before. It’s basically like a twist on the <a href="https://farahjeats.com/recipe/garlic-chili-oil-noodles-10-minutes/">Garlic Chilli Oil Noodles (10 minutes)</a>, but in ramen form.

        <h1>Garlic Chili Oil Ramen</h1>
        <p>
            For those who are huge fans of both spicy food and garlic like I am, this is the dish for you! With a few quick steps, you can turn soup-based instant noodles into an easy broth-less version, infused with garlic chili oil for that bit of heat.
        </p>

        <p>
            The key step is by placing the aromatics and instant ramen seasoning in a bowl before pouring sizzling hot oil onto the mixture, which coaxes the flavor out.

            Having said that, the hissing and frizzling sounds that come from this technique enticed people to the point of wanting to give it a try. And partnered with the fact that it can be cooked within a matter of minutes, these noodles became an instant hit online!

            I love eating this with a fried egg but you can also add on your preferred choice of protein to make it into a complete meal.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your favourite instant noodle:</strong>I prefer using the original Shin Ramyun.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Neutral oil</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Garlic:</strong>Minced.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Green Onion:</strong>
                    Diced, white and green part separated.
                </li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
                <li>Light soy sauce</li>
                <li>Rice vinegar</li>
                <li>Sesame oil</li>
                <li>Egg (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil dried instant noodles according to packet instructions with the dried vegetables. Reserve the spice packet for later. Drain the noodles and set aside.</li>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, add half of the seasoning packet, minced garlic, the white parts of the green onion, sugar and chili flakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat up 3 tbsp of neutral oil over high heat until it starts to smoke (1 minute), turn off heat and immediately pour the oil into the bowl. Mix it well then add the cooked noodles, rice vinegar and the rest of the green onions. Mix the noodles until well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat up a frying pan over medium high heat with the remaining oil. Once the oil is hot enough (15 to 30 seconds), gently break an egg and let it cook until the edges turn golden and crispy and the yolk has reached your preferred doneness. Serve with the noodles and enjoy!
                </li>
            </ol>
